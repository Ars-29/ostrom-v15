Hi team,

The frontend is ready for backend integration. We need 2 API endpoints to be implemented:

1. POST /api/auth/verify-password
   Request Body: { "password": "string" }
   Response: { "success": true/false, "message": "string", "token": "optional" }

2. POST /api/auth/request-password
   Request Body: { 
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "secretsFound": { "street": 5, "road": 6, "plane": 4 },
     "totalFound": 15,
     "totalLabels": 15
   }
   Response: { "success": true/false, "message": "string" }

Complete API specification with all details, request/response formats, error handling, and example API calls is in CLIENT_API_SPECIFICATION.md file.

The frontend code is already implemented in src/utils/api.ts and ready to connect once your endpoints are live.

Please let us know:
1. The backend API base URL (we'll set it in environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL)
2. When endpoints are ready for testing

Thanks!
